# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System project! This project demonstrates my skills in building a movie recommendation system using data science techniques.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- **Movie recommendation system/**
  - `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Dataset containing credits information
  - `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Dataset containing movie details
  - `movie.py`: Python script implementing the recommendation system
  - `Website.html`: Home page of the web interface (not connected due to Flask issues)
  - `thank_you.html`: Thank you page of the web interface (not connected due to Flask issues)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the movie recommendation system:

1. Clone this repository by running: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-recommendation-system.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd Movie-recommendation-system`
3. Make sure you have Python installed.
4. Run the `movie.py` script using: `python movie.py`

The recommendation system will analyze the data and provide movie recommendations based on user preferences.

## Libraries Used

- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## About the Recommendation System

The `movie.py` script uses data from `tmdb_5000_credits.csv` and `tmdb_5000_movies.csv` to create a movie recommendation system. It employs text-based similarity techniques to suggest movies that are similar to the ones users have shown interest in.

## Additional Web Pages

I have also created a home page (`home.html`) and a thank you page (`thank_you.html`) for this project. However, I encountered Flask-related issues while trying to connect these pages. I'm actively working to resolve this and will update the project as soon as the issues are resolved.

## Future Improvements

- Explore more advanced recommendation algorithms.
- Enhance the user interface for a more interactive experience.
- Implement user personalization for more accurate recommendations.
